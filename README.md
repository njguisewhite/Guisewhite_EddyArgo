Code started with Dr. Nancy Williams:

ArgoFloatPandas_Jan2021 represents the first script written with Dr. Nancy Williams.  
While it is not actively being used as part of current research, portions from this code 
  are being used/replicated in work being done for Dr. Chambers.
The code examines a single float, creates many plots looking at the float track relative 
  to fronts and eddy location, calculates best use of MLD (which is something we are 
  re-evaluating when the Chambers lab meets next, and uses the function BGC_plot to create 
  plots by station of the biogeochemical properties observed by the float.  
This code also includes calculations for Ekman pumping that were used to help understand MLD.

BGC_plot is the script for the function used to look at biogeochemical data observed by the 
  float.


Code started with Dr. Don Chambers:

Exploring_Matchups is the code examining the entire SOCCOM fleet for use to compare against 
  data from the ongoing Saildrone mission.  It is actively being used and updated (in a 
  different repository, and reflects the work performed as a part of the Chambersâ€™ Lab.
  
Float_Comparing_Guisewhite is the code examining the entire SOCCOM fleet as well as the 
  individual float examined within Work with Dr. Nancy Williams.  It is actively being used 
  and updated (in a different repository), pulling from ideas and methods learned from work 
  with Dr. Nancy Williams as well as Exploring_Matchups.  This code reflects the main 
  contributions towards my thesis as well as goals towards finalizing my research.
  
SingleFloatEddyMatchup represents an example of how to use Dr. Veronica Tamsitt's eddy_matchup 
  function with its outputs.  While the pickle created within this script is not currently 
  in use, it will be imported into Float_Comparing_Guisewhite as a part of my analysis in 
  Float_Comparing_Guisewhite.
